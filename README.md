# Connect4 in python
You are expected to spend at least 2-3 hours outside of class on this project per week for the next 12 weeks. Keep a log of how much time you spent on the project and what you learned. </br>

Save everything to GitHub and submit a link to your repository once a month.</br>

For this week, create a problem statement with the following components:</br>

Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)</br>
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)</br>
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)</br>
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)</br>
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)</br>
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)</br>
Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)</br>



10/1: Decided on making connect 4 in python.

Problem statement: How can I write connect 4 in the python language?

10/4: Spent all day searching for a way to integrate a matrix into python. Found a pip called numpy that allows for this.
10/5: Installing packages isnt the easist I found, at least for a beginner. I did manage to figure it out on the windows platform. by creating a '.bat' file in the python 37 folder.

10/8: I have gotten most of the matrix based game down. I continue to tweak the program.

10/10: I have gotten the code all finish so that the game is fully functioning. It is a bit plain, so I will look to add color to the pieces so that its a bit more colorful and fun.

10/15: I finally figured out why numpy wouldnt install to my python 3.7 on my mac. It is because that Mac osx comes with python 2.7 in its system so using the "pip install nuympy" in the terminal installs it to the older version. but if we tweak this command slightly we can get it to install to our 3.7 python by typing the following "pip3 install numpy". I will be using this to also install pygame which I am hoping will make the more pleasing to the eye.
