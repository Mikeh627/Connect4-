1) To help me write a game, I will be using python packages or one in particular to create this connect 4 game. numpy is an array, 
it will help with complext algorithms while writing connect 4

2) So after figuring out how to install numpy thanks to helpful tutorials, we can move onto creating the game and to start we will
import the package. "import numpy as np" the "as" statement will allow us to use numpy's scripts without having to type "numpy" out
overall giving the coded a cleaner look.

3) Now there is a major question that arises, where to start? Well a quick google images search of connect 4 gives us alot of what we
need, connect for is a game consisting of 6 rows and 7 columns. Here is where we will begin.

The code used for importing this board: 
            def create_board():  <-- defining what the board is
                board = np.zeros((6,7))  <--- (rows, columns)
                return board 
we can test to see if we are returned a matrix by simply asking python to print it for us:

if we set board = to create.board()
then print(board)
